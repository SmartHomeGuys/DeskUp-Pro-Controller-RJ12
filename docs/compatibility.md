# ⚠️ Check if your desk is compatible
You should understand the risks before purchasing any components to build this yourself or if you purchase a prebuilt one from the shop. It's your responsibility to determine if its fit for your purpose. 

- Your Maidesite desk must have a free RJ12 port on the controller.

- There is no guarantee that this device will work with your desk due to the different models out there. and the desk manufacturer can change their specifications at anytime even on the same model number.

- As this is a product of reverse engineering (by the community), until you try it on your desk there is no way to be 100% certain that it will or won't work.

## Maidesite desks using the Standard controller
This has a very similar design to the Premium one above but as of now no one in the community has tested it.

It has the same 4 presets and nudge up/down as the Premium controller above does, it just has a slightly different screen layout. It does have an RJ12 port. There is a chance this might be compatible.

- T1 Pro
- SN1

## Maidesite desks using other controllers 
These are a very different design so are unlikely to work, and am currently unable to determine if they even have an RJ12 port.

- TO1 
- T4 Pro Plus
