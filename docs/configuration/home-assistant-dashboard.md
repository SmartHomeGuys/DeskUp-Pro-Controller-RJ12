# Example Home Assistant Dashboard Card

On here we are using the custom button-card to show:
- The current height of the desk.
- How long the desk has been idle for.
- The 4 desk memory preset buttons with the height of each pulled in from the desk via the sensors.

And using the 'Mushroom Cover Card' to render the height cover.

After 30 minutes with the desk at sitting height the background changes colour on the 'Desk Idle Time' card to indicate its time to standup.

Yaml for this:
