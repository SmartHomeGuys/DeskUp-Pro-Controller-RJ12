# Setup your DeskUp Pro Controller
When you first power on the DeskUp Pro it's Led will be solid Red, this just means it is not connected to your Wi-Fi, once it is the Led will be off.

## Step 1: Connect to Wi-Fi
To do this choose from one of these options:

[Setup using Bluetooth (for Home Assistant users with a Bluetooth proxy)](setup-using-bluetooth.md)

[Setup using USB](setup-using-usb.md)

## Step 2: Add to Home Assistant (optional)
If you missed it in the previous guides, you can add the device so it appears in Home Assistant by following [this guide](add-to-home-assistant.md).  


## Step 3: Adopt the device in ESPHome in Home Assistant (Optional)

The last thing you need to do is specify your desk's physical minimum and maximum height limits.
